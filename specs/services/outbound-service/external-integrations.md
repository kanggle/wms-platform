# outbound-service — External Integrations

External vendor catalog for `outbound-service`. Required artifact per
`rules/traits/integration-heavy.md` § Required Artifacts (1).

This document declares **every** external system `outbound-service`
integrates with — direction, auth, timeouts, circuit-breaker policy, retry
policy, observability hooks. Implementation must match these declarations.
Changes here precede code changes (per `CLAUDE.md` Contract Rule).

The marquee integration in this service is the **outbound TMS push** — a
real outbound HTTP call subject to the full `integration-heavy` rule set
(I1–I4, I7–I9). The other vendors mirror the inbound-service catalog.

---

## Catalog Summary

| Vendor | Direction | Protocol | Auth | Required for |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **External ERP** | inbound (receive) | HTTPS webhook | HMAC-SHA256 | Order reception |
| **External ERP** | outbound (push ack) | — | — | **Not in v1** |
| **External TMS** | outbound (push) | HTTPS REST | API key (`X-Tms-Api-Key`) | Shipment-ready notification |
| **Kafka cluster** | both | TCP / SASL | mTLS or SCRAM | event publish + saga reply / master snapshot consume |
| **PostgreSQL** | outbound (DB) | TCP | password | persistence |
| **Redis** | outbound (cache) | TCP | password | idempotency store |
| **Secret Manager** | outbound (config) | HTTPS | service-account / IAM | webhook secret + TMS API key retrieval |

Internal services (`master-service`, `inventory-service`,
`gateway-service`, `admin-service`) are not "external" — they live in the
same project, share the same Kafka cluster, and follow internal-event
contracts in `specs/contracts/`. They are documented in
[`specs/services/outbound-service/architecture.md`](architecture.md) §
Dependencies.

---

## 1. External ERP — Inbound Webhook (Order Push)

The ERP system pushes order events to `outbound-service` via HTTPS
webhook. This is the primary integration path between ERP and the outbound
flow in v1; ERP does not poll any outbound REST endpoint, and we do not
push acks back to ERP.

### 1.1 Endpoint

```
POST {gateway-base}/webhooks/erp/order
```

Routed via `gateway-service` to `outbound-service:8084/webhooks/erp/order`.

Full wire-level contract:
[`specs/contracts/webhooks/erp-order-webhook.md`](../../contracts/webhooks/erp-order-webhook.md)
(Open Item).

### 1.2 Authentication

- **HMAC-SHA256** signature over the raw request body.
- Secret: per-environment shared secret in Secret Manager
  (`erp-order-prod`, `erp-order-stg`, `erp-order-dr`). Distinct from the
  inbound-service ASN secret — separate secret per logical channel.
- Header: `X-Erp-Signature: sha256=<lowercase-hex>`.
- Verified before any other processing — failure returns 401 with no DB
  writes.

### 1.3 Anti-Replay

- `X-Erp-Timestamp` window: ±5 minutes (configurable
  `outbound.webhook.erp.timestamp-window-seconds`, max 600s).
- `X-Erp-Event-Id` dedupe via `erp_order_webhook_dedupe` table (7-day
  retention).

### 1.4 Inbound Side: Failure Modes (per I10)

| Scenario | Response | DB effect | Observable |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bad signature | 401 `WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_INVALID` | none | metric `outbound.webhook.received.total{result=signature_invalid}` |
| Stale timestamp | 401 `WEBHOOK_TIMESTAMP_INVALID` | none | metric `..{result=timestamp_invalid}` |
| Unknown source | 401 `WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_INVALID` | none | metric `..{result=signature_invalid}` (no secret available) |
| Schema invalid | 422 `VALIDATION_ERROR` | none | metric `..{result=schema_invalid}` |
| Duplicate event-id | 200 `ignored_duplicate` | dedupe row only (no inbox write) | metric `..{result=duplicate}` |
| Domain validation fails (master ref unknown, partner inactive) | 200 `accepted` synchronously; later inbox `status=FAILED` | inbox row + dedupe row + later FAILED status update | metric `outbound.webhook.processing.failure.total{reason}` |
| DB unavailable during ingest | 503 `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` | none | infra-level alert |
| Background processor backlog > 100 PENDING | 200 `accepted` (ingest unaffected) | inbox row queues | gauge `outbound.webhook.inbox.pending.count` alerts |

Tests covering each: see
[`specs/contracts/webhooks/erp-order-webhook.md`](../../contracts/webhooks/erp-order-webhook.md)
§ "Failure-mode Test Cases" (Open Item).

### 1.5 Backpressure

- Webhook accepts requests as fast as the DB can write
  `erp_order_webhook_inbox` + `erp_order_webhook_dedupe` rows (~1 ms each).
- The **background processor** — not the webhook — does the heavy domain
  work (creating Order + OutboundSaga + outbox rows). It runs every 1s,
  picks up `LIMIT 50` PENDING rows.
- If ERP saturates the webhook, the backlog grows (not a request failure).
- Gauge `outbound.webhook.inbox.pending.count > 100` is an alert; ops
  scales the processor cron interval down to 0.5s, or temporarily
  increases the batch size.

### 1.6 ERP-side Retry Expectations

We do not control ERP retry behavior, but document our expectations so the
integration team can compare with their ERP vendor's behavior:

- ERP retries on 5xx and connection failure with exponential backoff (we
  recommend min 30s, max 5 attempts).
- ERP retries on 503 with same `X-Erp-Event-Id`.
- ERP must NOT retry on 401 / 422 — those are caller-side fixes.
- After retries exhaust, ERP escalates to **its own** DLQ; ops investigates
  via the integration's runbook.

### 1.7 Outbound to ERP (NOT IN v1)

Pushing order acks back to ERP is out of scope for v1. ERP polls our
`GET /api/v1/outbound/orders?status=SHIPPED` (synchronous read) for
reconciliation. v2 may add an outbound webhook (`POST {erp-base}/wms/order-ack`).
When introduced:

- Outbound HTTP client: WebClient with `connectTimeout=5s`,
  `readTimeout=30s`
- Circuit breaker: Resilience4j `erpAckCircuit`,
  fail-rate-threshold=50%, sliding-window=60s
- Retry: 3 attempts, exponential backoff with jitter (1s → 2s → 4s ±20%)
- Idempotency: outbound payload includes our `eventId` (= the outbound
  outbox event id) so ERP can dedupe

These are placeholders — fully specified when v2 is scheduled.

---

## 2. External TMS — Outbound Shipment Push (integration-heavy core)

TMS (Transportation Management System) is the carrier-coordination
platform that schedules pickup and produces tracking numbers. After a
Shipment is confirmed, `outbound-service` pushes the shipment to TMS via
HTTPS so TMS can dispatch the carrier.

This is the **only outbound HTTP integration** in v1 outbound-service and
the canonical exercise of `integration-heavy` rules I1–I4, I7–I9.

### 2.1 Endpoint

```
POST {tms-base}/shipments
```

`{tms-base}` is environment-specific — `https://tms.example.com/api/v1`
in prod, distinct values in stg/dr/dev. Loaded from configuration and
overridable per-environment.

Full wire-level contract:
[`specs/contracts/http/tms-shipment-api.md`](../../contracts/http/tms-shipment-api.md)
(Open Item — vendor-controlled).

### 2.2 Authentication (per `platform/security-rules.md`)

- **API key** in header: `X-Tms-Api-Key: <key>`.
- Secret: per-environment in Secret Manager (`tms-prod`, `tms-stg`,
  `tms-dr`). Loaded at boot via `SecretRetriever` port; cached in memory.
- Rotation: two-key window — `current` and `previous` both supplied
  during cut-over (TMS supports multi-key in v1).
- TLS: TMS server certificate validated against the system trust store;
  no certificate pinning in v1.

### 2.3 Adapter Layout

Per Hexagonal architecture
([`architecture.md`](architecture.md) § Architecture Style):

```
adapter/out/tms/
├── TmsClientAdapter.java            // implements ShipmentNotificationPort
├── TmsShipmentRequest.java          // vendor-shaped DTO (out)
├── TmsAcknowledgement.java          // vendor-shaped DTO (in)
└── TmsShipmentMapper.java           // Shipment ↔ TmsShipmentRequest (I8)
```

`ShipmentNotificationPort` lives in `application/port/out/`. The domain
calls `port.notify(shipment)` without knowing TMS exists — full ports &
adapters separation per `integration-heavy` I7 (vendor adapter) and I8
(internal model translation).

### 2.4 Timeouts (I1)

| Stage | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `connectTimeout` | **5 s** | TMS hostname must resolve and TCP handshake within 5s; longer means TMS or network is degraded |
| `readTimeout` | **30 s** | TMS p99 response time observed at 8–12s during peak; 30s gives 2–3× buffer |
| Total per-attempt budget | ~30 s | Sum of connect + read |

Implementation: WebClient (Spring WebFlux) with reactor-netty client.
Configured through a dedicated `WebClient` bean named `tmsWebClient`, not
shared with any other vendor.

### 2.5 Circuit Breaker (I2)

Resilience4j `tmsShipmentCircuit`:

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| `failureRateThreshold` | 50% |
| `slidingWindowType` | `COUNT_BASED` |
| `slidingWindowSize` | 20 |
| `minimumNumberOfCalls` | 10 |
| `waitDurationInOpenState` | **60 s** |
| `permittedNumberOfCallsInHalfOpenState` | 3 |
| `automaticTransitionFromOpenToHalfOpenEnabled` | true |
| `recordExceptions` | `WebClientResponseException.InternalServerError`, `WebClientRequestException`, `TimeoutException` |
| `ignoreExceptions` | `WebClientResponseException.BadRequest` (4xx is caller bug, not TMS health) |

When OPEN: calls fail fast with `CallNotPermittedException`. The adapter
translates this to a domain-level
`ExternalServiceUnavailableException` and the saga moves to
`SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED` (see §2.10).

State exposed as gauge `outbound.tms.circuit.state` (0=closed, 1=half-open,
2=open).

### 2.6 Retry (I3)

Resilience4j `tmsShipmentRetry`:

| Property | Value |
|---|---|
| `maxAttempts` | **3** (1 initial + 2 retries) |
| `waitDuration` | starts at 1s |
| `intervalFunction` | exponential `2^(attempt-1)` capped at 4s, plus jitter |
| Jitter | uniform random ±200ms per attempt |
| `retryExceptions` | `WebClientResponseException.InternalServerError`, `WebClientResponseException.ServiceUnavailable`, `WebClientResponseException.GatewayTimeout`, `TimeoutException`, `WebClientRequestException` (transport-level) |
| `ignoreExceptions` | `WebClientResponseException.BadRequest`, `WebClientResponseException.Unauthorized`, `WebClientResponseException.Forbidden`, `WebClientResponseException.UnprocessableEntity`, `CallNotPermittedException` (circuit fast-fail does not retry) |

Effective delay sequence: ~1s, ~2s, ~4s (each ±200ms).

After retry exhaustion the adapter throws
`ExternalServiceUnavailableException`. The saga handler translates to
`SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED` (§2.10).

### 2.7 Idempotency Toward TMS (I4)

- Header: `Idempotency-Key: {shipment.id}` — UUID, stable for the lifetime
  of the shipment record. Same key on retry (Resilience4j) and on manual
  re-notify (`POST /shipments/{id}:retry-tms-notify`).
- TMS contract guarantees that a repeat call with the same key and same
  body returns the original ack. If TMS is in mid-process, it returns 409
  / 202 (vendor-specific) — adapter treats both as "already accepted" and
  returns the cached ack.
- Local fallback: `tms_request_dedupe(request_id PK, sent_at,
  response_snapshot)` table records the first successful send. If TMS
  fails to honor the key (e.g., vendor regression), the local table is
  the ground-truth: a second adapter invocation reads the snapshot and
  short-circuits without a network call.

Adapter pseudo-code:

```
1. SELECT response_snapshot FROM tms_request_dedupe WHERE request_id = shipment.id
2a. Found: return TmsAcknowledgement.fromSnapshot(snapshot)
2b. Not found:
    → POST {tms-base}/shipments with Idempotency-Key=shipment.id
    → on success: INSERT tms_request_dedupe(request_id, sent_at, response_snapshot)
                  return ack
    → on permanent failure: do not insert; let exception propagate
```

The `INSERT` runs in its own short transaction (`Propagation.REQUIRES_NEW`)
so the saga's main TX can already be committed (TMS call happens
**after** TX commit per §2.10).

### 2.8 Bulkhead (I9)

- Resilience4j `ThreadPoolBulkhead` `tmsShipmentBulkhead`:

  | Property | Value |
  |---|---|
  | `maxThreadPoolSize` | **10** |
  | `coreThreadPoolSize` | 5 |
  | `queueCapacity` | 20 |
  | `keepAliveDuration` | 20 ms |

- Dedicated to TMS only. **Not shared** with HTTP server pool, DB pool,
  Kafka pool, or any future vendor pool.
- Saturation behavior: if all 10 threads are busy and the 20-slot queue
  is full, additional submissions throw `BulkheadFullException`. Adapter
  treats as `EXTERNAL_SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` and saga moves to
  `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED`.

### 2.9 Internal Model Translation (I7, I8)

Mapping `Shipment` (domain) → `TmsShipmentRequest` (vendor) is performed
in `TmsShipmentMapper`, package-private inside `adapter/out/tms/`. The
domain model never leaks vendor-shaped fields. Inverse for
`TmsAcknowledgement` (vendor response) → domain values applied via
`Shipment.recordTmsAck(...)`:

| Vendor field | Domain field | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `tms_shipment_id` | (not stored) | Vendor-internal handle |
| `carrier_code` | `Shipment.carrier_code` | Assigned by TMS — populated post-ack |
| `tracking_number` | `Shipment.tracking_no` | Same |
| `accepted_at` | `Shipment.tms_notified_at` | TMS clock; we accept skew |
| `status` (`ACCEPTED` / `REJECTED` / `PENDING_CARRIER_ASSIGNMENT`) | `Shipment.tms_status` | `ACCEPTED|PENDING_CARRIER_ASSIGNMENT` → `NOTIFIED`; `REJECTED` → `NOTIFY_FAILED` |

### 2.10 Failure States and Saga Coupling

The saga handler (`OutboundSagaCoordinator.confirmShipping(...)`) calls
`port.notify(shipment)` **after** the saga's main TX commits. This is
intentional — per `transactional` rule T2 (no distributed TX), the TMS
call cannot be inside the saga TX, otherwise a TMS failure would roll
back the inventory-confirm event publication.

Sequence:

```
1. ConfirmShippingUseCase @Transactional:
   - Order.confirmShipping() → SHIPPED
   - Create Shipment(tms_status=PENDING)
   - Saga.transitionTo(SHIPPED)
   - Outbox row: outbound.shipping.confirmed
   - COMMIT

2. Async (after-commit hook or scheduler picks up SHIPPED shipments):
   - port.notify(shipment) via TmsClientAdapter
   - on success: Shipment.tms_status=NOTIFIED, tms_notified_at=now()
   - inventory.confirmed event arrives → Saga.transitionTo(COMPLETED)

3. Failure path (after retry / circuit / bulkhead exhaustion):
   - Shipment.tms_status=NOTIFY_FAILED, failure_reason populated
   - Saga.transitionTo(SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED), failure_reason populated
   - Alert fires: outbound.tms.notify_failed.count > 0
   - Stock is already consumed (inventory.confirmed already in flight or
     completed) — TMS is the only loose end
```

Manual retry: `POST /api/v1/outbound/shipments/{id}:retry-tms-notify`.
This re-invokes the adapter with the same `Idempotency-Key`. On success,
the saga moves from `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED` to `COMPLETED`. The endpoint
itself is naturally idempotent — calling it twice for an already
`NOTIFIED` shipment returns the cached ack without a TMS call.

### 2.11 4xx / Permanent Failures

| HTTP status | Treatment | Saga outcome |
|---|---|---|
| 200 / 201 | `ACCEPTED` | Saga eventually `COMPLETED` |
| 202 | `PENDING_CARRIER_ASSIGNMENT` (still success) | Same as 200 |
| 400 `VALIDATION_ERROR` | No retry. Domain bug — alert. | `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED`, `failure_reason=TMS_VALIDATION_REJECTED` |
| 401 / 403 | No retry. Secret rotation issue. | `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED`, alert ops |
| 404 (vendor account) | No retry. Config issue. | `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED`, alert ops |
| 409 (vendor-specific dup) | Adapter treats as success (idempotency honored) | `COMPLETED` after `inventory.confirmed` |
| 422 | No retry. Schema mismatch. | `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED`, `failure_reason=TMS_SCHEMA_REJECTED` |
| 429 (rate limit) | Retry per backoff | If exhausted: `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED` |
| 5xx | Retry per backoff | If exhausted: `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED` |
| Timeout | Retry per backoff | Same |

### 2.12 Observability (TMS-specific, per integration-heavy)

| Metric | Description |
|---|---|
| `outbound.tms.request.count{result=success|timeout|5xx|4xx|circuit_open|bulkhead_full}` | Counter of TMS calls by outcome |
| `outbound.tms.request.duration.seconds` | Histogram p50/p95/p99 |
| `outbound.tms.retry.count{attempt=1|2|3}` | Counter of retry attempts |
| `outbound.tms.circuit.state` | Gauge: 0=closed, 1=half-open, 2=open |
| `outbound.tms.bulkhead.available` | Gauge of free slots in pool |
| `outbound.tms.notify_failed.count` | Counter; alerts at >0 |
| `outbound.tms.dedupe.cache_hit.count` | Counter of `tms_request_dedupe` short-circuits |
| `outbound.saga.shipped_not_notified.count` | Gauge of sagas stuck in `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED` |

Logs (structured JSON):

- `tms_request_started` `{shipmentId, attempt}` (DEBUG)
- `tms_request_succeeded` `{shipmentId, durationMs, trackingNo}` (INFO)
- `tms_request_failed` `{shipmentId, attempt, error, durationMs}` (WARN
  per attempt; ERROR after exhaustion)
- `tms_circuit_opened` (WARN, fires alert)
- `tms_circuit_closed` (INFO)

Tracing: TMS call is a child span `tms.shipment.notify` of the saga's
trace. Carries `shipment.id` and `attempt` attributes.

---

## 3. Kafka Cluster

### 3.1 Direction

- **Outbound (publish)**: 7 topics for outbound events (see
  `specs/contracts/events/outbound-events.md` § Topic Layout — Open
  Item):
  `wms.outbound.order.received.v1`, `wms.outbound.order.cancelled.v1`,
  `wms.outbound.picking.requested.v1`,
  `wms.outbound.picking.cancelled.v1`,
  `wms.outbound.picking.completed.v1`,
  `wms.outbound.packing.completed.v1`,
  `wms.outbound.shipping.confirmed.v1`.
- **Inbound (consume)**: 4 inventory reply topics
  (`wms.inventory.{reserved,released,confirmed,adjusted}.v1`) +
  6 master-data topics
  (`wms.master.{warehouse,zone,location,sku,lot,partner}.v1`).

### 3.2 Connection

- Bootstrap: `kafka.brokers` (env-driven, 3+ brokers in prod).
- Auth: SASL/SCRAM-SHA-512 in dev/staging; mTLS in prod (per
  `platform/security-rules.md`).
- Client property `client.id = outbound-service-{instance-id}` for
  broker-side monitoring.

### 3.3 Producer Config (outbox publisher)

```yaml
spring.kafka.producer:
  acks: all                       # await all in-sync replicas
  retries: 5                      # broker-side retries (additive to outbox-level retry)
  enable-idempotence: true        # exactly-once-on-broker semantics
  max-in-flight-requests-per-connection: 5
  compression-type: lz4
  request-timeout-ms: 30000
  delivery-timeout-ms: 120000
  properties:
    linger.ms: 5
    batch.size: 16384
```

Outbox publisher (separate from broker retries):

- Reads `outbound_outbox` rows where `published_at IS NULL`.
- Publishes one row per `KafkaTemplate.send()` call.
- Partition key: `partition_key` column (set to `saga_id` for saga
  events; `order_id` for order lifecycle events). This guarantees per-saga
  in-order delivery for cross-service correlation.
- On broker ACK: sets `published_at = now()`.
- On broker NACK: leaves `published_at = null`. Next scheduled run
  retries.
- Backoff between retries: exponential 1s → 2s → 4s → 8s → 16s (capped).
- Metrics: `outbound.outbox.pending.count`, `outbound.outbox.lag.seconds`
  (now - oldest unpublished row's `created_at`),
  `outbound.outbox.publish.failure.total`.

### 3.4 Consumer Config

```yaml
spring.kafka.consumer:
  group-id: outbound-service
  auto-offset-reset: earliest
  enable-auto-commit: false
  isolation-level: read_committed
  max-poll-records: 50
  fetch-max-bytes: 5242880          # 5 MiB
  session-timeout-ms: 45000
  heartbeat-interval-ms: 10000
  properties:
    spring.json.trusted.packages: com.wms.outbound.adapter.in.messaging
```

Per-listener:
- `concurrency: 3` (matches partition count for inventory and master
  topics).
- Manual ACK after successful TX commit.
- `DefaultErrorHandler` with backoff `[1s, 2s, 4s]` then DLT routing.

### 3.5 Failure Modes

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Broker unreachable on publish | Outbox publisher retries; `outbound_outbox.pending.count` grows; alerts at >100 |
| Broker partition leader election | Producer waits up to `delivery-timeout-ms`; transparent in steady state |
| Consumer poll returns stale leader | Auto-recovery on next rebalance; observable via `KafkaConsumer` metrics |
| Consumer hits unparseable record | Routed to DLT immediately; alert on `kafka.consumer.dlt.records.total > 0` |
| Consumer hits transient DB failure (`OptimisticLockingFailureException` on saga) | Retried 3 times then routed to DLT; usually saga state advances by then and re-poll absorbs as no-op via §4 of idempotency.md |
| Network partition between service and Kafka | Producer keeps outbox backlog; consumer pauses. Recovery is automatic on partition heal |
| Saga sweeper re-emits an event already published | Not a Kafka issue — sweeper writes a fresh outbox row; downstream consumer absorbs via state-machine guard |

### 3.6 No Distributed Transactions (T2)

- Outbox is local-DB-only. Kafka publish is a separate step that observes
  the committed outbox row. There is no XA transaction across DB and
  Kafka.
- Consumer commits offset only after the domain TX commits — at-least-once
  semantics are inherent.

---

## 4. PostgreSQL

### 4.1 Direction

Outbound (read + write). One logical DB per service —
`outbound_service_db`. Owned exclusively; no other service connects.

### 4.2 Connection

- HikariCP via Spring Boot.
- `spring.datasource.url=jdbc:postgresql://{host}:{port}/outbound_service_db`.
- Pool size: 20 connections (default), tunable via
  `spring.datasource.hikari.maximum-pool-size`.
- Connection timeout: 5s.
- Validation timeout: 5s.

### 4.3 Migrations

- Flyway, baseline V1 — see
  `apps/outbound-service/src/main/resources/db/migration/`.
- Naming: `V{n}__{description}.sql`.
- Repeatable: `R__{description}.sql` for views (none in v1).

### 4.4 Failure Modes

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| DB connection pool exhausted | Request blocks up to `connection-timeout`; then 503 `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` |
| DB read replica lag (when using replica) | v1 reads from primary only; no replica involvement |
| DB master failover | Application reconnects via DNS / pgbouncer; brief 503 window. Outbox publisher resumes from where it stopped. Saga sweeper resumes on next tick |
| Migration failure on startup | Pod fails to start (CrashLoopBackOff). Manual rollback via Flyway `clean` + `migrate` |

### 4.5 No Direct ORM Access from Domain

Per Hexagonal architecture (`platform/architecture.md` and
`.claude/skills/backend/architecture/hexagonal/SKILL.md`): JPA entities
are package-private inside the persistence adapter. Domain models
(including `Order`, `OutboundSaga`, `Shipment`) are pure POJOs without
`@Entity` / `@Table` annotations.

---

## 5. Redis

### 5.1 Direction

Outbound (read + write). Used for:

- REST `Idempotency-Key` storage (24h TTL).
- (Future) Webhook ingest backpressure throttling — not v1.

### 5.2 Connection

- Spring Data Redis with Lettuce client.
- Single Redis instance in dev; sentinel cluster in staging/prod.
- Connection timeout: 2s.
- Command timeout: 1s.
- Key prefix convention:
  `outbound:idempotency:{method}:{path_hash}:{idempotency_key}`.

### 5.3 Failure Modes

| Scenario | Behavior (idempotency surface) |
|---|---|
| Redis unreachable during write | REST endpoint fails closed → 503 `SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE` (matches inventory-service / inbound-service convention) |
| Redis unreachable during read | Same |
| Redis evicts entry due to memory pressure | Treat as cache miss — request flows to use-case. Domain unique constraints (`order_no`, `outbound_saga.order_id`, `shipment.order_id`) backstop |

### 5.4 Choice of Failure Mode

`outbound-service` REST idempotency **fails closed** (matches inventory
and inbound). Justification: idempotency is a correctness boundary; a
missed dedupe lets a mutation execute twice. For outbound this is
particularly load-bearing — a duplicated `confirm-shipping` would
double-fire the saga's terminal step before the state-machine guard can
absorb it (Redis is the first line of defense; the state-machine guard is
the last).

---

## 6. Secret Manager

### 6.1 Direction

Outbound (read). Used for:

- Per-environment ERP order-webhook HMAC secrets (`erp-order-prod`,
  `erp-order-stg`, `erp-order-dr`).
- Per-environment TMS API keys (`tms-prod`, `tms-stg`, `tms-dr`).
- Future: outbound ERP API tokens (v2).

### 6.2 Provider

- v1 dev: env-var fallback (`ERP_ORDER_WEBHOOK_SECRET_<ENV>`,
  `TMS_API_KEY_<ENV>`) for local testing.
- v1 prod: AWS Secrets Manager (or equivalent — concrete provider chosen
  at deploy time).
- Refresh cadence: cached at boot; `SIGHUP`-style refresh via Actuator
  `RefreshScope` endpoint (admin-only).
- Rotation procedure: two-secret window — `current` and `previous` both
  acceptable during cut-over. Documented in
  [`specs/contracts/webhooks/erp-order-webhook.md`](../../contracts/webhooks/erp-order-webhook.md)
  § Security Notes (Open Item).

### 6.3 Failure Modes

| Scenario | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Secret Manager unreachable at boot | Pod fails to start (no fallback in prod). Health check fails |
| Secret Manager unreachable at refresh | Old (cached) secret continues to work; refresh logs WARN. Ops triggers manual re-fetch |
| Secret value missing for declared `X-Erp-Source` | Webhook with that source gets 401 `WEBHOOK_SIGNATURE_INVALID` (no secret to compare against) |
| TMS API key missing | TMS adapter throws on first call; saga moves to `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED`; alerts ops |

---

## 7. Aggregated Resilience Policy

| Vendor | Timeout (connect / read) | Circuit Breaker | Retry (count, base, max) | Idempotency | Bulkhead | DLQ / Recovery |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| ERP webhook (in) | n/a (we receive) | n/a | n/a (ERP-side) | `X-Erp-Event-Id` 7d dedupe | n/a | inbox `FAILED` queue |
| **TMS (out)** | **5s / 30s** | **50% over 20, open 60s** | **3, 1s/2s/4s + ±200ms jitter** | **`Idempotency-Key={shipment.id}` + `tms_request_dedupe` table** | **Pool 10** | `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED` saga state + manual retry endpoint |
| Kafka producer | 5s / 30s | n/a (outbox absorbs) | 5 broker, exp-backoff | `eventId` (downstream) | Spring default | outbox stays unpublished |
| Kafka consumer | (broker session) | n/a | 3 in-process, [1,2,4]s | `eventId` 30d dedupe + saga state-machine guard | Spring default | `<topic>.DLT` |
| PostgreSQL | 5s / (statement) | n/a (failure → 5xx) | 0 (TX retry on 409 only) | n/a | HikariCP 20 | n/a |
| Redis | 2s / 1s | n/a (failure → 5xx) | 0 (fail-closed) | n/a | Lettuce default | n/a |
| Secret Manager | 3s / 5s | n/a (boot-only path) | 3, exp-backoff | n/a | n/a | n/a |

Bulkhead (`integration-heavy` I9): TMS requires its own dedicated thread
pool (declared in §2.8). Kafka producer/consumer use Spring's default
thread pools, which are isolated from the HTTP server's request
threadpool. PostgreSQL has its own HikariCP pool. **No pool is shared**
across vendors.

## 8. Observability (Cross-Vendor Summary)

Per `rules/traits/integration-heavy.md` § Interaction with Common Rules:

| Metric | Vendor | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `outbound.webhook.received.total{result}` | ERP-in | Counter of webhook outcomes |
| `outbound.webhook.processing.lag.seconds` | ERP-in | Histogram of inbox-receipt-to-applied lag |
| `outbound.webhook.processing.failure.total{reason}` | ERP-in | Counter by domain failure code |
| `outbound.webhook.inbox.pending.count` | ERP-in | Gauge of PENDING inbox rows |
| `outbound.webhook.dedupe.hit.rate` | ERP-in | Computed metric |
| `outbound.tms.request.count{result}` | TMS-out | Counter of TMS calls by outcome |
| `outbound.tms.request.duration.seconds` | TMS-out | Histogram p50/p95/p99 |
| `outbound.tms.retry.count{attempt}` | TMS-out | Counter of retry attempts |
| `outbound.tms.circuit.state` | TMS-out | Gauge 0=closed, 1=half-open, 2=open |
| `outbound.tms.bulkhead.available` | TMS-out | Gauge of free slots |
| `outbound.tms.notify_failed.count` | TMS-out | Counter; alerts at >0 |
| `outbound.outbox.pending.count` | Kafka-out | Gauge of unpublished outbox rows |
| `outbound.outbox.lag.seconds` | Kafka-out | Histogram of oldest unpublished row age |
| `outbound.outbox.publish.failure.total` | Kafka-out | Counter of publish failures |
| `outbound.consumer.received.total{topic, outcome}` | Kafka-in | Counter by topic + applied/duplicate/failed |
| `outbound.consumer.dlt.records.total{topic}` | Kafka-in | Counter; alerts at >0 |
| `outbound.event.dedupe.hit.rate` | Kafka-in | Computed metric |
| `outbound.event.dedupe.table.size` | Kafka-in | Gauge of dedupe row count |

Logs (structured JSON, INFO level — see
[`idempotency.md`](idempotency.md) § Observability for the precise event
keys; TMS-specific keys in §2.12 above).

Tracing (OTel):

- Webhook ingest creates a root span `webhook.erp.order.ingest` with
  `event.id` and `source` attributes.
- Background processor inherits the trace via `traceId` carried through
  the `erp_order_webhook_inbox` row.
- Outbound Kafka publish carries the trace via `traceparent` Kafka
  header.
- TMS call is a child span `tms.shipment.notify` of the
  `confirm-shipping` use-case trace, with `shipment.id` and `attempt`
  attributes.

## 9. Test Suite (per `integration-heavy` I10)

All external-integration paths must have failure-mode tests using fakes:

| Path | Test framework |
|---|---|
| ERP webhook ingest | Spring Boot integration test (controller called directly), no real ERP |
| Background processor | Testcontainers PostgreSQL + fake `MasterReadModel` snapshots |
| **TMS adapter** | **WireMock** — success, timeout, 5xx, 4xx, circuit-open, bulkhead-full, manual retry. See `architecture.md` § Testing Requirements > TMS Adapter for the exact matrix |
| Kafka producer (outbox) | Testcontainers Kafka |
| Kafka consumer (inventory replies + master snapshots) | Testcontainers Kafka, poison-record case routes to DLT |
| Saga consumer + state-machine guard | Testcontainers Kafka — feed same event with fresh eventIds, assert no double-transition |
| Redis idempotency | Testcontainers Redis |
| Secret Manager | Mock `SecretRetriever` interface (port adapter) |

Tests for production vendor SDKs (e.g., AWS Secrets Manager client) use
LocalStack or equivalent — the service code does not reach real AWS
during test runs.

## 10. Per-Vendor Runbook Pointers

When an integration breaks in production, ops follows the per-vendor
runbook (stored in `docs/runbooks/<vendor>.md` of the deploying repo, NOT
in this spec):

- ERP webhook outage → `docs/runbooks/erp-order-webhook.md`
  - Drains PENDING inbox, escalates to ERP integration owner
- TMS outage → `docs/runbooks/tms.md`
  - Identify `SHIPPED_NOT_NOTIFIED` sagas, batch-trigger
    `:retry-tms-notify`, escalate to TMS vendor
- Kafka cluster outage → `docs/runbooks/kafka.md`
- PostgreSQL primary failover → `docs/runbooks/postgres.md`

These are operational documents, not specs. Linked here for completeness.

---

## 11. Not In v1

- Outbound webhook to ERP (push order ack)
- mTLS instead of HMAC for inbound webhook
- Multi-tenant ERP / multi-tenant TMS (one secret per
  customer-supplier instead of per-env)
- TMS quote / rating API (carrier rating is v2)
- TMS push of pickup-completion / delivery-completion events back into
  outbound (carrier tracking → notification-service in v2)
- Scanner / RFID adapter for picking confirmation
- Notification provider integration (handled by `notification-service`,
  not outbound-service)
