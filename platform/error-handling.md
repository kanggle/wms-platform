# Error Handling

Defines the platform-wide error response format and error code conventions.

---

# Registry Structure

This document is the **platform-wide error registry**. It contains two kinds of error codes:

1. **Platform-Common** — errors that every project inherits regardless of domain/traits.
   Sections: `Authentication`, `Authorization`, `Registration`, `Validation`, `Rate Limiting`, `OAuth`, `General`.
   These must be carried over verbatim when bootstrapping a new project.

2. **Domain-Specific** — errors that belong to the active primary domain declared in `PROJECT.md`.
   Sections below the `Platform-Common` block are tagged with their owning domain (e.g. `[domain: saas]`).
   When a new project is bootstrapped with a different domain, replace the existing domain sections with the matching domain's error codes.

For the active domain's context and business semantics of each code group, see
[`rules/domains/<domain>.md`](../rules/domains/) → `Standard Error Codes` section. The current project declares `saas`, so the authoritative file is [`rules/domains/saas.md`](../rules/domains/saas.md).

**Change protocol**:
- New platform-common error codes → add to this file only.
- New domain-specific error codes → add to this file **and** cross-reference from the matching `rules/domains/<domain>.md`.
- Do not duplicate the error table inside domain rule files. This document is the single authoritative registry.

# Error Response Format

All services must return errors in the following JSON format:

```json
{
  "code": "string",
  "message": "string",
  "timestamp": "string (ISO 8601)"
}
```

- `code`: machine-readable error code in UPPER_SNAKE_CASE
- `message`: human-readable description (must not contain sensitive data)
- `timestamp`: UTC time of the error in ISO 8601 format

# HTTP Status Code Mapping

| Situation | HTTP Status |
|---|---|
| Validation failure (missing/invalid field) | 400 Bad Request |
| Authentication failure (invalid credentials, missing token) | 401 Unauthorized |
| Authorization failure (insufficient permission) | 403 Forbidden |
| Resource not found | 404 Not Found |
| Conflict (duplicate resource) | 409 Conflict |
| Unprocessable business rule violation | 422 Unprocessable Entity |
| Rate limit exceeded | 429 Too Many Requests |
| Internal server error | 500 Internal Server Error |
| Upstream returned an error response (e.g. OAuth provider, PG) | 502 Bad Gateway |
| Upstream dependency unavailable | 503 Service Unavailable |

# Standard Error Codes

## Authentication

| Code | HTTP | Description |
|---|---|---|
| INVALID_CREDENTIALS | 401 | Email or password is incorrect |
| INVALID_REFRESH_TOKEN | 401 | Refresh token not found or expired |

| UNAUTHORIZED | 401 | Access token missing or invalid |

## Authorization

| Code | HTTP | Description |
|---|---|---|
| ACCESS_DENIED | 403 | Insufficient permissions to access resource |

## Registration

| Code | HTTP | Description |
|---|---|---|
| EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS | 409 | Email is already registered |

## Validation

| Code | HTTP | Description |
|---|---|---|
| VALIDATION_ERROR | 400 | Request field is missing or fails validation |

## Rate Limiting

| Code | HTTP | Description |
|---|---|---|
| RATE_LIMIT_EXCEEDED | 429 | Too many login attempts. Try again later. |

## OAuth

| Code | HTTP | Description |
|---|---|---|
| INVALID_STATE | 400 | OAuth state is invalid or expired |
| OAUTH_UPSTREAM_ERROR | 502 | OAuth provider returned an error |

## General

| Code | HTTP | Description |
|---|---|---|
| NOT_FOUND | 404 | Requested resource does not exist |
| INTERNAL_ERROR | 500 | Unexpected server-side error |
| DOWNSTREAM_ERROR | 503 | A downstream internal service returned 5xx/timed out after retries exhausted (fail-fast for audit-heavy paths) |
| CIRCUIT_OPEN | 503 | Downstream circuit breaker is OPEN; the call was rejected without reaching the dependency. Distinct from DOWNSTREAM_ERROR so dashboards can separate "we tried and it failed" from "we shed load". Operators should wait for the CB half-open probe before retrying. |
| SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE | 503 | A required upstream service is unavailable |

# Rules

- Services must never expose stack traces, internal class names, or SQL in error responses.
- Error codes must be registered in this document before use.
- `GlobalExceptionHandler` (or equivalent) must handle all unhandled exceptions and return the standard format.
- Validation errors must use `VALIDATION_ERROR` and include the first failing field message.
- Business rule violations must use a domain-specific code (e.g. `EMAIL_ALREADY_EXISTS`), not `VALIDATION_ERROR`.

---

# Change Rule

New error codes must be added to this document before being used in implementation.
